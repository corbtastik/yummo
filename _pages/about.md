[Yummo](https://github.com/corbtastik/yummo) is a tasty little theme for multi-page sites.

* Simple to use, low-to-no dependencies other than Jekyll.
* Sass based [theming](/samples/theming) with dark and light modes.
* Snazzy [photo](/samples/lightbox) and [code-snippet](/samples/code-snippets) support.
