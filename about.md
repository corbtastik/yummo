[Yummo](https://github.com/corbtastik/yummo) is a tasty little theme for static built sites, this one is for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) but in the not-too-distant future it will be available for [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

For many years now I've used Jekyll for various technical ramblings, photo galleries and my out of date site [corbs.io](https://corbs.io). I've never been really happy with the sites I've curated 

## Thanks

I'm a developer by trade with roots in C and Java. I once read something like - _"write code every day"_ and although I haven't, I like to try. I enjoy frontend development but consider myself a hack. I get by, but get by with a little help from my friends.

> Many thanks for these resources and the folks behind them.

### [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

When I want an unvarnished take on HTML, CSS, and Javascript I go to [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). That and every time I google for frontend related stuff [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) comes up. Great reference material, some of which guided the [Yolo Lightbox](#image-lightbox) implementation.

### [Solo](http://chibicode.github.io/solo/)

Years ago I googled _"minimal jekyll theme"_, which led me to [Solo](http://chibicode.github.io/solo/). It was exactly what I was looking for, simple to get started and customize. Not to mention there's a quirky beauty in its look. Over the years I've used Solo for single page "technical" docs.

Yolo is cut from the cloth of "[Solo](http://chibicode.github.io/solo)" which was previously developed by [Shu Uesugi](https://github.com/chibicode).

> Well done [Shu Uesugi](https://github.com/chibicode), sanks amigo.

### [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)

_"The modern CSS framework that just works"_, true dat. Bulma is not included as a library, but Yolo contains slightly modified scss from select areas, namely flexbox, typography and image styling. For my tastes Bulma is the best css framework, they be awesome yo.
