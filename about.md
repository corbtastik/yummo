## work

I'm a developer by trade with roots in C and Java. I once read something like - _"write code every day"_ and although I haven't, I like to try.

* [__Red Hat__](https://www.redhat.com): Current gig as an Application Architect, Container, and K8s nerd.
* [__MongoDB__](https://www.mongodb.com): Solutions Architect for my favorite database.
* [__Pivotal Software__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivotal_Software): Platform Architect, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Spring Boot, and Redis geek.
* [__PDX__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pdx/): Software Architect and Java developer for a Pharmacy applications.
* [__Raytheon__](https://raytheon.com): Software Developer for remote sensing platforms, lots of math, Java and C/C++.
* __Martin Household__: "Home Eco" on steroids, laborer, day-dreamer.


## schooling

Just when I think I "know" something, there's a "wrinkle", and I don't. Schooling has a start and end date but learning is a lifelong pursuit.

* [__Southern Methodist University__](https://www.smu.edu): Graduate work for Computer Engineering.
* [__University of Texas at Arlington__](https://www.uta.edu): Undergrad degree in Computer Science.
* [__Tarrant County College__](https://www.tccd.edu): Associates degree in Microelectronics.

### Apple Mac Pros

The [Apple Mac Pro](https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/) has been a "hobby" machine of mine for a while. The [2010, Mac Pro 5,1](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_pro/specs/mac-pro-twelve-core-2.93-mid-2010-westmere-specs.html) was my first dream machine. Stuffed with 128 GB memory, 2 Intel Xeon chips (12 cores total), 4 TB of storage, and a 30-inch Cinema Display, it's still useful in 2022. Used as a vSphere homelab and at one point this machine ran 50 virtual machine and a deployment of Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Enterprise MongoDB...fun times!
