## Paragraph text

[Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball) is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding. The game is in play when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. - copied from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball).
