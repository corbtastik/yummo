You can add custom JavaScript to a Yummo page or post by adding front matter as shown below.

For example this post uses:

```yaml
# name of the JavaScript file in /assets/ext/js/ without the .js ext
ext_js: custom
```

Which adds the following `<script>` tag before the closing `</body>` tag.

```html
<body>
    <!-- Your post content here -->
    <script src="/assets/ext/js/custom.js"></script>
</body>
```

The `custom.js` JavaScript simply tests if `localStorage` is available, if so it saves a message and prints it using `console.log`. If you open your browser developer console you'll see it.
