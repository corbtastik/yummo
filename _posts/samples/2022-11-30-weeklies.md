Yummo has the ability to generate simple weekly reports for those organized types. This feature is somewhat self-serving as I need a concise, repeatable way to chronicle work that I do from week to week.

> The __weeklies__ feature is loosely integrated with Yummo, the bash script `./src/templates/weekly.sh` can be used to generate a weekly report post with the correct front-matter and post format.

### Create a weekly

* Run the `./src/templates/weekly.sh` script to create a new weekly report.

#### For today's date

* Create a weekly in `_posts/weeklies` with today's date and week number.

{% include code.html label="Generate a weekly" %}
```bash
./src/templates/weekly.sh --dir ./_posts/weeklies
```

#### For a specific date

* Create a weekly in `_posts/weeklies` with for a specific date.
* Pass the `--date` option in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

{% include code.html label="Generate a weekly for specific date" %}
```bash
./src/templates/weekly.sh --dir ./_posts/weeklies \
  --date 2022-10-31
#= yummo creating new weekly ==========================================
#  - title: weekly
#  -  date: 2022-10-31
#  -  week: 44
#  -  file: ./_posts/weeklies/2022-10-31-weekly-44.md
#======================================================================
```

#### With custom title

* By default, the weekly title is `weekly/${weekNumber}`.
* Pass the `--title` option to customize.

{% include code.html label="Generate a weekly for specific date" %}
```bash
./src/templates/weekly.sh --dir ./_posts/weeklies \
  --date 2022-11-07 \
  --title acme-project 
#= yummo creating new weekly ==========================================
#  - title: acme-project
#  -  date: 2022-11-07
#  -  week: 45
#  -  file: ./_posts/weeklies/2022-11-07-acme-project-45.md
#======================================================================
```

### Weekly post template

* The `./src/templates/weekly.sh` is a [heredoc](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html) that outputs a weekly post in markdown.
* See the one sample weekly [here](/weekly/48).
