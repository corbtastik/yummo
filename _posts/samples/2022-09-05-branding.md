## Branding

Branding isn't implemented as a typical [gem based Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/), but the colors and fonts can be customized as described below.

> Every Yummo "brand" has a "theme" and corresponding "syntax theme".
>   * __See__: `_sass/yummo/brand/theme` for themes.
>   * __See__: `_sass/yummo/brand/syntax` for syntax themes.

## Themes

1. Create a new `scss` file in `_sass/yummo/brand/themes/`.
2. Customize the theme values for __light__ and __dark__ modes.
3. Enable by setting `brand.theme` in `_data/settings.yml`.

### Color Variables
{:.no-toc}

There are __3__ main variables that define the colors for a theme.

1. __`primary-color`__: Page background
2. __`secondary-color`__: Headers H1-H6
3. __`tertiary-color`__: Accent elements

The remaining colors should harmonize with the `primary-color`, `secondary-color`, and `tertiary-color` you select.

> __Remember:__ You must specify color values for both __light__ and __dark__ mode.

#### On Colors
{:.no-toc}

"_On_" colors are placed "_on_" the corresponding "_main_" or "_container_" color.

> __Note:__ __On__ colors should contrast with the underlying color to increase readability.

#### Container Colors
{:.no-toc}

"_Container_" colors represents an inset or sibling element of a primary or secondary colored element.

> __Note:__ There isn't a `tertiary-container-color`, as `tertiary-color` is meant to <ins>standalone</ins> as an accent color.

#### Link Color
{:.no-toc}

Links are prominent on web pages, so it gets its own variable - [link-color](https://github.com/corbtastik/yummo).

> __Tip:__ It's a good idea to consistently apply a distinct color for your links.

## Syntax Themes

Yummo uses Jekyll's [default syntax highlighting](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#code-snippet-highlighting) capabilities provided by [rouge](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge), and adds the ability to use custom `syntax-theme(s)` for light and dark modes.

> __Note__: Every theme included with Yummo has a corresponding syntax theme.
>   * __See__: `_sass/yummo/brand/theme` for themes.
>   * __See__: `_sass/yummo/brand/syntax` for syntax themes.

When you create a custom `syntax-theme` you specify colors for each syntax token variable, which maps to the appropriate rouge css selector.

### Custom Syntax Theme
{:.no-toc}

1. Creating a custom `syntax-theme` is done by adding a `scss` file into `_sass/yummo/brand/syntax` and setting values for each color property for both __light__ and __dark__ modes.
2. To enable a specific `syntax-theme` add it to your `settings.yml` file, as shown below.

{% include components/code.html label="Configure the syntax-theme" %}
```yaml
# -------------------------------------
# Yummo site settings
# -------------------------------------
name: Yummo
title: Yummo on my friend
description: A tasty wittle theme
brand:
  # references _sass/yummo/brand/theme/_reveal.scss
  theme: reveal
  # references _sass/yummo/brand/syntax/_reveal.scss
  syntax: reveal
```

{% include components/arrow.html link="#howdy" %}

---

### Syntax Swatches
{:.no-toc}

The swatches below show the colors for the `syntax-theme` in use, each swatch has the syntax token and the corresponding css selector in parentheses.
