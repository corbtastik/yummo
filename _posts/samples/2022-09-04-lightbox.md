Yummo includes a Lightbox to showcase pics.

> __Tip:__ Click an image to open Lightbox, click left or right, key `<` or `>` to move.

* Add image data into `_data/lb-images.yml`.
* Include `image/lightbox.html` on your page.

{% include components/arrow.html %}

---

## Default data file

The `_data/lb-images.yml` file is the default Lightbox data file, just replace with your data to display images.

{% include components/code.html label="Images from: _data/lb-images.yml" %}
{% raw %}
```html
{% include image/lightbox.html %}
```
{% endraw %}

{% include image/lightbox.html %}

{% include components/arrow.html %}

---

## Custom data file

A custom data file can be added to create a Lightbox.

* Create a new file in `_data` and prefix name with `lb-`.
* Use the data file name (w/o `.yml` ext) as the value to `lb-data`.

{% include components/code.html label="Images from: _data/lb-marfa.yml" %}
{% raw %}
```html
{% include image/lightbox.html lb-data="lb-marfa" %}
```
{% endraw %}

{% include image/lightbox.html lb-data="lb-marfa" %}

{% include components/arrow.html %}
