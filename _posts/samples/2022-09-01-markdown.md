## Paragraph text

[Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball) is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding. The game is in play when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". - copied from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball).
