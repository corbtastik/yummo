Yummo has a `toc.html` include that can be added on posts and pages to generate a table-of-contents.

* The `toc.html` generates a table-of-content from header tags.
* To exclude a header tag from the outline add `{:.no-toc}` class under the header.

The [samples/markdown](/samples/markdown) post is used here to demonstrate adding a table-of-contents.

The game is in play when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. - copied from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball).
