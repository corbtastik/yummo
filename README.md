## Yummo, a tasty wittle theme

> Yummo is in the oven, you can use, but it's undercooked.

[Yummo](https://github.com/corbtastik/yummo) is a tasty little theme for multi-page sites, this one is for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) but in the not-too-distant future it will be available for [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

> [Yummo](https://corbtastik.github.io/yummo) is essentially what I want in a static multi-page site.
> * Simple to use, low-to-no dependencies other than Jekyll.
> * Sass based theming with dark and light modes.
> * Snazzy photo and code-snippet support.

### History

I've used Jekyll for various technical ramblings, photo galleries and my personal site [corbs.io](https://corbs.io) for quite some time. I've never been really satisfied with the sites, mostly because I couldn't find a single theme that met all my needs.

So I first crafted [Yolo](https://corbtastik.github.io/yolo/), _a loveable theme_ laser focused on single-page sites. [Yolo](https://corbtastik.github.io/yolo/) helped build a foundation for page content, but it's not a multi-page theme. The next step was bringing [Yolo](https://corbtastik.github.io/yolo/) together with a multi-page theme and that's basically [Yummo](https://corbtastik.github.io/yummo).

### Thanks

I'm a developer by trade with roots in C and Java. I once read something like - _"write code every day"_ and although I haven't, I like to try. I enjoy frontend development but consider myself a hack. I get by, but get by with a little help from my friends.

> Many thanks for these resources and the folks behind them.

When I want an unvarnished take on HTML, CSS, and Javascript I go to [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). That and every time I google for frontend related stuff [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) comes up. Useful reference material.

#### [Solo](http://chibicode.github.io/solo/)

Over the years I've used [Solo](http://chibicode.github.io/solo/) for single page "technical" docs. Wonderful little theme that's easy to work with and the inspiration for [Yolo](https://corbtastik.github.io/yolo/).

> Well done [Shu Uesugi](https://github.com/chibicode), sanks amigo.

#### [No Style Please](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please)

Before starting work on [Yummo](https://corbtastik.github.io/yummo) I looked for something close to what I wanted in a multi-page theme. [No Style Please](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please), by [Riccardo Graziosi](https://github.com/riggraz) checked some boxes, namely minimal dependencies and straight forward site organization. [Yummo](https://corbtastik.github.io/yummo) borrows site organization from [No Style Please](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please) but adds different layouts and a whole different style.

> Kudos [Riccardo Graziosi](https://github.com/riggraz)!
